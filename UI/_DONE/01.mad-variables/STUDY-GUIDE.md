# Mad Variables: Study Guide

In this challenge, you'll learn about variables. Variables are like containers that can hold different types of information. Much like in algebra, you can use variables to store values and change them as needed. 

## The Basics of Variables

### Declaring Variables
In JavaScript, we create (or "declare") variables using the `let` keyword:
```javascript
let heroName = "Luna";
```

Think of this like naming a character in your story. You're saying "let there be a hero named Luna!"

### Types of Variables in Our Story

1. **Strings (Text) 📝** ```javascript
let heroName = "Luna";      // Your hero's name
let heroHobby = "reading";  // What they love to do
```
- Strings are text wrapped in quotes
- Perfect for words and sentences
- Used for: heroName, heroHobby, magicalAbility
2. **Numbers 🔢**```javascript
let heroAge = 12;           // Your hero's age
let numberOfSnacks = 3;     // How many snacks they have
```
- Numbers don't need quotes
- Can't be negative in our story
- Must be whole numbers (integers)
- Used for: heroAge, numberOfSnacks
3. **Booleans (True/False) ✅** ```javascript
let isHero = true;         // Are they a good hero?
```
- Only has two possible values: true or false
- No quotes needed
- Used for: isHero

## Common Mistakes to Avoid 🚫

1. **Don't Forget the Quotes for Strings**
```javascript
// Wrong
let heroName = Luna;

// Right
let heroName = "Luna";
```

2. **Don't Use Quotes for Numbers**
```javascript
// Wrong
let heroAge = "12";

// Right
let heroAge = 12;
```

3. **Don't Use Quotes for Booleans**
```javascript
// Wrong
let isHero = "true";

// Right
let isHero = true;
```

## Tips for Success 🌟

1. **Check Your Types**
- Strings are for text (use quotes)
- Numbers are for counting (no quotes)
- Booleans are for yes/no answers (true/false)
2. **Meaningful Names**
   - Variables should have names that describe what they contain
   - They can't start with numbers
   - They are case-sensitive (heroName and HeroName are different)
3. **Preview Often**
   - Click the "Preview Story" button to see how your variables affect the story
   - Red highlights mean something's wrong
   - Green highlights mean you've done it correctly!

## Step-by-Step Guide 📝

1. Open `script.js`
2. Find the TODO section at the top
3. Declare each variable needed for the story:
```javascript
let heroName = "Luna";          // Your hero's name (string)
let heroAge = 12;               // Their age (number)
let heroHobby = "reading";      // What they love (string)
let numberOfSnacks = 3;         // Snacks in backpack (number)
let magicalAbility = "fly";     // Their power (string)
let isHero = true;             // Are they good? (boolean)
```
4. Click "Preview Story" to see your story come to life!

## Challenge Yourself! 🚀

Once you've got the basic story working, try:
1. Using different names and ages
2. Changing the hobby to something unusual
3. Giving your hero a unique magical ability
4. Seeing what happens if you use the wrong type (learn from the errors!)

## Need Help? 🆘

If your story isn't working:
1. Check that all variables are declared (using `let`)
2. Verify strings have quotes around them
3. Make sure numbers don't have quotes
4. Confirm isHero is set to `true` (no quotes)
5. Look for any red highlights in the story preview

Remember: Every great coder started just like you - learning one variable at a time. Keep experimenting and have fun with your story! 🎨
