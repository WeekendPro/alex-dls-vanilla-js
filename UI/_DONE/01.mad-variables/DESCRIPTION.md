# Instructions for the Madlib Challenge

Welcome to the Madlib Challenge! This exercise is designed to help you practice the basics of JavaScript by completing a fun and interactive story. You will declare variables in the provided JavaScript file (`script.js`) to fill in the blanks in the story. Follow the instructions below to complete the challenge.

---

## Objective
Your goal is to complete the story titled **"The Spark Within"** by assigning appropriate values to the variables in the `solution` function in the `script.js` file. Each variable corresponds to a blank in the story, and your task is to provide values that make the story coherent and entertaining.

---

## Steps to Complete the Challenge

1. **Open the `script.js` file**:
   - Locate the `solution` function in the `script.js` file.
   - Inside the function, you will see a list of variables that need to be assigned values.
2. **Assign values to the variables**:
   - Each variable has a specific data type (e.g., `string`, `number`, `boolean`). Make sure to assign values of the correct type.
   - For example: ```javascript
   let heroName = "Luna"; // string
   let heroAge = 23; // number
   let isEnergyControlled = true; // boolean
   ```
3. **Follow the variable descriptions**:
   - Each variable corresponds to a specific part of the story. Use the descriptions below to guide your choices:
     - `homeTown`: The name of the town where the story takes place.
     - `heroAge`: The age of the main character.
     - `heroName`: The name of the main character.
     - `dangerousActivity`: An activity the hero was engaged in when they discovered their power.
     - `publicPlace`: A public location where the discovery happened.
     - `noun`: A thing or object that erupted from the hero.
     - `bodyPart`: A part of the hero's body where the power manifested.
     - `energyLevel`: A number representing the force of the power.
     - `animal`: An animal that was startled by the power.
     - `funnyLocation`: A humorous or quirky location where the hero retreats.
     - `largeIndoorObject`: A large object inside the hideout.
     - `distance`: A number representing how far the hero can light the object.
     - `isEnergyControlled`: A boolean (`true` or `false`) indicating whether the hero's energy is mostly controlled.
     - `eventCount`: A number representing how many experiments the hero conducted.
     - `isExperimentalSuccess`: A boolean (`true` or `false`) indicating whether one of the experiments was completely unsuccessful.
     - `targetScore`: A number representing the hero's goal for energy mastery.

4. **Test your solution**:
   - Open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the story update with your variable values.
   - If a variable is incorrect (e.g., wrong data type), the corresponding blank will show an error.

5. **Iterate and improve**:
   - If the story doesn't make sense or has errors, revisit your variable assignments and adjust them as needed.

## Acceptance Criteria (Deliverables)

To successfully complete the challenge, ensure the following:

1. **All variables are assigned values**:
   - Every variable in the `solution` function must have a value. No variable should be left undefined.

2. **Correct data types are used**:
   - Ensure that each variable is assigned a value of the correct data type (e.g., `string`, `number`, `boolean`).

3. **The story is coherent and complete**:
   - The story should make sense and be free of errors when displayed in the browser.

4. **No errors in the browser**:
   - When you open the `index.html` file, there should be no error messages in the browser console, and all blanks in the story should be filled correctly.
