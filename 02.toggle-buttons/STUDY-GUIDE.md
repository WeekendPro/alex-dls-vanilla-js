# Getting Started

- Open your terminal and run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
- Find the `script.js` file in the `02.toggle-buttons/app` folder, and write JavaScript to get the tests to pass.

## Deliverables

1. Set the initial text content for the buttons.
- upDown: `Up`
- dayNight: `Day`
- leftRight: `Left`
2. Set a common `btn` class on all buttons.
3. Set a descriptive class for each button:
- upDown: `up`
- dayNight: `day`
- leftRight: `left`
4. Add a click event listener to each button that toggles the text content of the button between two states:
- upDown: `Up` and `Down`
- dayNight: `Day` and `Night`
- leftRight: `Left` and `Right`
5. Add a click event listener to each button that toggles the descriptive class of each button between two states:
