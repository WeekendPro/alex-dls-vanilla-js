## TASKS

- Update `getStringLengths` with a function that takes an array of strings and returns a new array containing the length of each string.
- Update `incrementNumbers` with a function that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array where each number is incremented by 1.
- Update `invertBooleans` with a function that takes an array of boolean values and returns a new array where each boolean is inverted (true becomes false and vice versa).
- Update `makeNameTag` with a function that takes an array of objects and returns a new array of name tag strings. Given an object `{name: 'Ariel', age: 38, city: 'San Francisco' }`, the name tag string should read: "I'm Ariel from San Francisco".
- Update `getNumberType` with a function that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array of strings where each number is classified as 'even' or 'odd'.
- Update `extractCityInfo` with a function that takes an array of user objects and returns an array of city names from each user's address (user.address.city). If a user has no address or city, return 'Unknown City'.
- Update `convertToFahrenheit` with a function that takes an array of Celsius temperatures and returns a new array of temperatures converted to Fahrenheit (F = C * 9/5 + 32).
- Update `createItemLabels` with a function that takes an array of values and returns a new array of strings formatted as "Item X: valueX" where X is the index.
- Update `getLargeNumbers` with a function that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array containing only numbers greater than 100.
- Update `findWordsWithE` with a function that takes an array of strings and returns a new array containing only strings that include the letter 'e' (case insensitive).
- Update `filterByAgeRange` with a function that takes an array of person objects and returns a new array containing only people whose age is between 18 and 65.
- Update `removeNullish` with a function that takes an array and returns a new array with all null and undefined values removed.
- Update `getUniqueValues` with a function that takes an array and returns a new array containing only unique values (using indexOf).
- Update `getEvenIndexedItems` with a function that takes an array and returns a new array containing only elements at even indices.
- Update `findPalindromes` with a function that takes an array of strings and returns a new array containing only the strings that are palindromes.
- Update `calculateSum` with a function that takes an array of numbers and returns their sum.
- Update `calculateProduct` with a function that takes an array of numbers and returns their product.
- Update `joinStrings` with a function that takes an array of strings and returns a single string containing all elements concatenated together.
- Update `findMaxNumber` with a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the largest number.
- Update `findMinNumber` with a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the smallest number.
- Update `countPositiveNumbers` with a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the count of positive numbers.
- Update `summarizeNumbers` with a function that takes an array of numbers and returns an object with counts of positive, negative, and zero values like {positive: 5, negative: 3, zero: 1}.
- Update `groupPeopleByCity` with a function that takes an array of person objects and returns an object where keys are cities and values are arrays of people from that city.
- Update `flattenArrays` with a function that takes an array of arrays and returns a single flattened array containing all elements.
- Update `implementMap` with a function that takes an array and a mapping function, and returns a new array with the mapping function applied to each element.
- Update `implementFilter` with a function that takes an array and a filtering function, and returns a new array containing only elements that pass the filter.
- Update `findLongestString` with a function that takes an array of strings and returns the string with the longest length.
- Update `logElements` with a function that takes an array and logs each element to the console.
- Update `markAsProcessed` with a function that takes an array of objects and adds an isProcessed: true property to each object.
- Update `logWithIndex` with a function that takes an array and logs "Index X has value Y" for each element.
- Update `calculateExternalSum` with a function that takes an array of numbers and a reference to an external sum variable, and adds the sum of the array to that variable. */
